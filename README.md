Empereur Pirate's books, tweaks &amp; How-to for iOS 10.x 32-bits

We won't publish any illegal content or IPA file, but only mention their names for experimental testing purposes and educational knowledge enhancement.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Experimental Problematic (E.P.) #1 :

How to background for free a fullscreen video while surfing on several internet tabs, using an Helix RC6 Jailbroken device with no ads at all and no illegal ++ tweak ?

-> Solved. (video is coming)

Hint (or maybe it's confusing) : Did you notice that some third parties browsers are duplicating safari's core to run their own frames ?

- E.P. #2 : 

How to restore a jailbroken ios 10 device without itunes and backup it on windows 10 LTSC ?

-> Solved.

You only need to use some trial versions or freewares : download Any iOS System repair for entering in recovery mode, then FonePaw for restoring and finaly iMazing for your backup. You also will need the signed IPSW software update file adapted for your Apple system ( https://ipsw.me ). Please note that you would need to unjailbreak your device by rebooting it, if you wanted to backup your apps. That would be impossible, if your jailbreak was a complete untethered one. So you have to prefer semi-untethered or therered jailbreak software for this purpose.

Tip : After a few crashes due to cydia tweaks, you may confront yourself to a more severe one. You could get the message "The system has come to an end point" (un point d'arrêt) Don't panic ! Try at first to use the full system suppression option in imazing, then to restore with the above procedure. If necessary, reinstall some trial versions from new sources over the net. Or you could also compile this awesome github project : https://github.com/libimobiledevice/idevicerestore (not E.P. tested at the moment)

- E.P. #3 : 

Where to find the adequate tools, when my government is harassing citizens against their fondamental rights to freely communicate, learn or access culture through the Internet, with undue intellectual property, censorship or global networks control ?

-> Solved.

Just search for what you need on google, wait I forgot the address, what was this french website name already, thingamabob.com, thingy or stuffy.fr, whatnot.net ? (Merry Xmas)

- E.P. #4 :

What to do at first with a fresh restored ios 10 install ?

-> Solved.

a) Wait for an impactor update (Please update to Xcode 7.3 or later), not coming before christmas 2019 : https://www.valuewalk.com/2019/11/fix-cydia-impactor-xcode-7-3-error/

b) Hope for a windows release of the new semi-tethered jailbreak software from checkra1n :

"This beta adds an option to boot into no-substrate mode. To utilise this functionality, hold the volume-up button when the apple logo appears until the device finishes booting. From there you’ll be able to uninstall any tweaks causing you issues, and reboot to get back to a normal jailbroken state."

Apparently, checkra1n is not compatible with ios 10 and starts with ios 12, that i to say, only for 64 bits devices. However, some 32 bits devices run cores that may be vulnerable to the checkm8 bootrom exploit...

c) Be an iosninja ! After a fresh restore, you would need to deeply clean your free memory, several times. After that, download your apps, music or files from icloud. If necessary, backup your signed apps with imazing. Then create a note using the apple "notes" app with all your favourites cydia sources (1 per line).
Finally, jailbreak with H3lix like a ninja, without impactor and without an apple developer account.
